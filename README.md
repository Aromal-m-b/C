This repository documents your C programming journey through a collection of programs, starting with fundamentals and growing with your knowledge.

Set up your development environment with a C compiler (GCC/Clang) and any necessary tools.
I am currently using the terminal to ceate execute these programs.To making it easy i have created some built in commands ,run.exe & start.exe 


copy paste the exe files in to the folder you saved youur c program

open terminal and access the folder where both the exe file and your c program is located 

run <program_name>.c   //compile and creae an exe file ,then execute it

open <program_name>.c  //creates a new c file or if the c file already exists then opens it


Explore the organized programs and their descriptions to understand their functionalities. Feel free to contribute by adding new programs, improving existing ones, or suggesting improvements to this readme file. 
Happy learning!
